# Do Football Players Take Penalty Kicks Optimally

This project will explore whether professional football players execute penalty kicks according to the optimal stragety predicted by game theory. By constructing a real 3x3 payoff matrix and solving for the mixed-stragety Nash Equilibirum, this analysis compares theory with real player frequencies.
